# LanguageApp
An extracurricular Java project made during Modern Programming Languages classes at the university. LanguageApp helps its users memorize words in English. It allows to save words with multiple translations and revise them in bulk up to 12 words at once. It makes use of an SQLite local database making it possible to manage its data via the app.

## Features:
+ Saving new words
+ Saving translations, one word can have multiple translations separated by a comma
+ Removing words
+ Wiping data (including auto-increment data)
+ A dictionary page with all terms listed, including its translations
+ An 'about' page to tell you more about the app
+ A progress bar to keep track of the remaining words to revise

I made LanguageApp using NetBeans IDE 17 and 19. I used SceneBuilder for creating the visual aspects of the app. Also I integrated it with a local SQLite database using a database driver.

The main directory of the project also contains a PDF document in Polish with a short rundown on the project
